    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p style="margin: 10px;">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the
        intelligence of human
        beings or animals. AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation
        systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa),
        self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and competing at the highest
        level in strategic games (such as chess and Go).<br><br>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic
        discipline in 1956.[2] The field went through multiple cycles of optimism followed by disappointment and loss of
        funding,but after 2012, when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques,there was a vast increase in
        funding and interest.<br><br>The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the
        use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation,
        planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence (the
        ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.To solve these problems, AI
        researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and
        mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics,
        probability, and economics.AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and many other
        fields.</p>

        <p style="margin-right: 5px;">Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms thatuses multiple layers
            to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower
            layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits
            or letters or faces.From another angle to view deep learning, deep learning refers to ‘computer-simulate’ or
            ‘automate’ human learning processes from a source (e.g., an image of dogs) to a learned object (dogs).
            Therefore, a notion coined as “deeper” learning or “deepest” learningmakes sense. The deepest learning
            refers to the fully automatic learning from a source to a final learned object. A deeper learning thus
            refers to a mixed learning process: a human learning process from a source to a learned semi-object,
            followed by a computer learning process from the human learned semi-object to a final learned
            object.<br><br>Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep
            reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks and transformers have been
            applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine
            translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and
            board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human
            expert performance. </p>

            <p style="margin-right: 5px;">Machine learning (ML) is an umbrella term for solving problems for which
                development of algorithms by human programmers would be cost-prohibitive, and instead the problems are
                solved by helping machines 'discover' their 'own' algorithms,without needing to be explicitly told what
                to do by any human-developed algorithms.Recently, generative artificial neural networks have been able
                to surpass results of many previous approaches.Machine learning approaches have been applied to large
                language models, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture and medicine, where
                it is too costly to develop algorithms to perform the needed tasks.<br><br>The mathematical foundations
                of ML are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods. Data mining is a
                related (parallel) field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised
                learning.<br><br>ML is known in its application across business problems under the name predictive
                analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically-based, computational statistics is an
                important source of the field's methods.</p>
